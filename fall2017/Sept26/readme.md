# Programming Challenge for September 26

Feel free to talk to other club members about these problems, and if you have any questions feel free to contact the club admins. If you need help using GitHub please talk to a club admin or consult the various online guide, such as this [article](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)

## Novice Challenge

This is a spin on the traditional FizzBuzz interview question. Print out the numbers 1 to 50 in order. When printing numbers, if a number is divisble by 3 print "RAM" instead. Replace numbers divisible by 5 with "Hacks". If a number is divisble by both numbers print "RAMHacks". 

Note that an answer key will be included called "solution.txt"

## Advanced Challenge

Advanced Challenges will be a problem selected from Kattis. While it is not necessary to create an account, and test your solution with the autograder, it is recommended. You should still commit your solution to the github repository so we can pull it up easily during a club meeting, should you decide to talk about it.
